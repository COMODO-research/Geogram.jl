## Description 
This project is a Julia wrapper for the [geogram C++ project](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram). 

For the moment the only functionality exposed by this wrapper is the remeshing (`vorpalite`) functionality in Geogram, which enables smooth remeshing of surfaces. Secondly the wrapper currently works by exporting a .obj file, calling geogram as an external executable using `run` with desired parameters set, and importing of the output .obj file. In the future the wrapper should feature a more complete and efficient interface by directly interfacing with the C++ code through Julia (e.g. using `ccall`).

# Installation
```julia
julia> ]
(@v1.xx) pkg> add https://github.com/COMODO-research/Geogram.jl
```

or 

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/COMODO-research/Geogram.jl")
```

# Getting started
To get started install the package, study the documentation, and test some of the demos provided in the [`examples`](https://github.com/COMODO-research/Geogram.jl/tree/main/examples) folder. 

# Documentation 
Under construction, see the demos provided for assistance at the moment. 

# Testing 
Under constructionm, basic manual testing is available through the demos in the examples folder. 

# Roadmap
- [x] Provide basic file export/import wrapping functionality (no `ccall` interface)
- [ ] Create proper `ccall`-based interface 

# How to contribute?
